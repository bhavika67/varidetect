# **Varidetect: Deepfake Detection Android Application**  

## **Overview**  
**Varidetect** is an Android application designed to detect deepfake images, videos, and audio. It leverages deep learning models to distinguish between real and manipulated media, helping users identify potential deepfake content.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Image Detection** â€“ Analyze images to detect AI-generated or manipulated content.  
âœ… **Video Detection** â€“ Scan videos for signs of deepfake tampering.  
âœ… **Audio Detection** â€“ Verify the authenticity of audio clips to detect synthetic voices.  
âœ… **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Simple and intuitive UI for easy detection.  
âœ… **Offline Capability** â€“ Some models can run locally for privacy and speed.  

## **How It Works**  
Varidetect uses deep learning models trained on large datasets of real and fake media. The app processes input files (images, videos, or audio) and provides a confidence score indicating whether the content is likely real or fake.  

### **Supported Models**  
- **Image Detection Model** â€“ CNN-based classifier for detecting manipulated images.  
- **Video Detection Model** â€“ Temporal analysis for spotting inconsistencies in videos.  
- **Audio Detection Model** â€“ Detects synthetic voice patterns using spectrogram analysis.  

## **Usage**  
1. Open **Varidetect**.  
2. Select the type of media you want to analyze (Image/Video/Audio).  
3. Upload or capture the media file.  
4. Wait for the analysis to complete.  
5. View the results (Real/Fake with confidence score).
